# School DB SQL

## Description

This is a command line application I developed for a school system. It uses SQL queries to operate around the functions of a regular school system. There are entry points to view, add, update, and delete schools, grades, classrooms, teachers, students, subjects, and marks. The application is built using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application uses a connected database to share information between different tables. It is a great representation for a fuctioning school system to keep its data organized and easily accessible.

## Usage

This is a command line application that allows you to view, add, update, and delete data from a school system database.
